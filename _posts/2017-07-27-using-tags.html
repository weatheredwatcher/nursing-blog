As a registered nurse, I am acutely aware of the profound and lasting impact that COVID-19 has had on individuals worldwide.

One of the central messages of the whitepaper is the imperative need for a multidisciplinary approach to address the multifaceted challenges of Long COVID. Healthcare providers, including nurses, play a pivotal role in coordinating care that recognizes the physical, mental, and emotional dimensions of this condition. Comprehensive care plans tailored to each patient's unique symptom profile are vital for optimizing outcomes.
